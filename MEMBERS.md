Feel free to make changes like add more developer spots etc if needed. The labels here are suggestions and I hope they should be correct. But if you find an error or need to add a new row do so.

When adding you name do so in this format: `[@AlexTelon](https://github.com/AlexTelon)` so it becomes a markdown link.
